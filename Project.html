      <h3>Shadman Efti</h3>
      <p>
  I think I have about 4/5 years of experience with programming, though I'm not
  that good at it. My hobbies consist of reading (I prefer the fantasy genre,
  mainly because it's just what I'm used to), Anime (though I don't really watch
  a lot of anime nowadays) and playing games like League of Legends. I can't
  really think of any of my dislikes for some reason as I am typing this...so I
  think I'll just leave it at: I dislike Tanks.</p>

    <h3>Year 1 Semester 2 Java Project</h3>
    <p>
        The game is a simple platformer. 
    </p>
      <p>
          As the player you have to proceed through each level whilst avoiding death. 
          To reach the end of a level you must get to the end goal, you complete the game by reaching the end of all 5 levels.
      </p>
      <p> Instructions: </p>
      <p>
          Q to move Left, W to move Right. Press any mouse button to jump, you can double jump if you press
          twice. You can kill enemies by jumping on them (this will also reset your jump count, meaning you can jump 2 more times
          after killing an enemy).

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Searching/Sorting Algorithms</h3>
    <p>
        My programming project to conclude the 2 weeks of bootcamp at city (2020).
        This project demonstrates understanding of arrays, loops and classes.
        I created a program that generates an array fill with random integers, if the
        user wants to they can interact by pressing 'r' to refill the array with a
        different set of values. Other than that, the user can press 'l' to perform a
        linear search, 'b' for binary search, 's' for bubble sort. I did have a second
        sorting algorithm, but it had problems that I could not identify - so I just
        decided to leave it out.
